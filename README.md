# Miraa

This is my personal programming project repository. It contains basic C and Python programs that I’m writing to improve my coding skills and understanding of computer science.

# What's Inside

## Projects:
- `hello.c` — Prints a greeting message
- `age_calculator.c` — Calculates a person's age based on input

# About This Repo

This project is part of my self-taught learning journey in programming. I'm building and pushing code regularly to become a skilled software engineer.
More projects will be added soon.
